# Project Title
This is repo for learning Stastics using python for Machine learning

[person's correlation
## Assumption of pearson's correlation 
1) Both Variables should be normally distributed 

2) There should be no significant outliesrs

3) Each variable should be continious 

4) Two variable should have linear relation ship ( draw scattter plot and see wetiher they have linear relation ship or not )

5) Variance of the residuals should be  constant across all levels of the independent variable.


## Limitation 
1) It only measure linear relationshp
2) It is sensitive to outliers 
3) It is not suitable for categorical data





## The Pearson correlation coefficient between two variables $X$ and $Y$ is calculated using the following formula:

$$
r_{XY} = \frac{\sum{(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}}{\sqrt{\sum{(X_i - \bar{X})^2}\sum{(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}}}
$$

Where:
- $r_{XY}$ is the Pearson correlation coefficient between $X$ and $Y$.
- $X_i$ and $Y_i$ are the observed values of variables $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
- $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$ denote the means of variables $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
